The style of the blog will be to explain important mathematical concepts that people often find difficult and tend to overlook when reading and learning. I will cover these concepts by discussing theorems, proofs, and calculations, and will occasionally provide visualizations and code. I will try to achieve this as thoroughly as possible.

### About me
